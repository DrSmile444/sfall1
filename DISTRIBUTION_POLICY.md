# Distribution Policy

Goal: make it easier for players and modders to find historical “sfall1”
builds.

We respect upstream licensing:
- If a package includes a license, we display and follow it.
- If licensing is unclear, we mark it as “unknown”. Preferably we link
  to the original page.

Takedowns:
If you are a rightsholder and want an item removed or annotated,
open an issue with proof of authorship.
We will act promptly.

We do not distribute any Fallout game assets.
